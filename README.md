# Learn Next.js & TailwindCSS - CRM Project

This is a small CRM project built for practicing **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**. The project demonstrates a simple implementation of a CRM system with features such as adding, editing, and managing companies. It leverages **TanStack React Query** for server state management and emphasizes routing and data fetching practices.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.
- **TailwindCSS**: Rapidly building responsive, modern UI components.
- **TanStack React Query**: Efficient data fetching, caching, and server state management.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented with Next.js file-based routing.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components for scalability.
- **Formik**: Simplified form handling and validation.

   - Leveraged scoped folder-based routes like (admin) for admin-specific functionality and (.) for default or shared routes.
   - Organized routes for better scalability, as demonstrated in the project structure.

3. **Fetching Data**:

   - Used custom fetch logic and TanStack React Query for API calls.
   - Demonstrated fetching categories, countries, and companies data.

4. **Form Handling**:

   - Leveraged Formik for creating forms with validation and integration into the CRM workflow.

5. **Component Reusability**:
   - Built modular and reusable components.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: [mockapi](https://mockapi.io/)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Forms**: Formik
- **UI Components**: TailwindCSS

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:

   - Add user authentication and role-based access control.

2. **Database Integration**:

   - Integrate a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

3. **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**:

   - Implement advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination for better data management.

4. **Enhanced UI/UX**:

   - Improve the user interface with animations and increased responsiveness.

5. **Testing**:
